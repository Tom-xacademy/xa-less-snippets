# Warning

This extension was created to generate a class name structure in a less file for xa-inputs, which is a private pacakge.
It's not recommended to install this extension.
Hence, the imports are most likely going to point to non-existent files for others.

Sadly, Microsoft still doesn't support private extensions so here it is...
